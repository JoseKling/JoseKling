**Greetings and welcome to my GitHub page.**

I have a B.A. and a M.A. in mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences at the University of São Paulo, one of the best, if not the best, university of Latin America. For the four years as a undergraduate I received a Academic Highlight award for having the best grades in class.  
Currently I am interested in Computer Sciences and Programming, more specifically in the fields of Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Image Processing and Data Analysis. I have been studying through online courses (Coursera, MIT Courseware) and books (Code, Elements of Statistical Learning, Python Data Science Handbook).  
I believe my mathematical background is an asset in these areas, since it allows me to understand complex topics in depth spending not too much time. Besides, I am passionate about learning and solving problems, specially when it involves logic and mathematical reasoning, so tasks that may seem daunting to many are actually a pleasure to me.  
Feel free to take a look at my projects. **If you have any questions, suggestions, requests or just want to get in touch, you are more than welcome to send me an e-mail.**
  
Best regards,  
José Kling
