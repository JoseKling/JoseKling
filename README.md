**Greetings and welcome to my GitHub page.**

I have a B.A. and a M.A. in mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences at the University of São Paulo.
I am currently a PhD candidate at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, researching long term relation between climate and volcanism.
Feel free to take a look at my projects. **If you have any questions, suggestions, requests or just want to get in touch, you are more than welcome to send me an e-mail.**
  
Cheers,
José Kling
