**Greetings and welcome to my GitHub page.**

I have a B.A. and a M.A. in mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences at the University of São Paulo.

I completed my doctoral studies at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, researching long term relation between climate and volcanism, especially the statistical modeling of the time distribution of eruptions and goodness-of-fit tests for point processes.

Two packages originated from this research, implementing estimation, simulation, and testing for point processes. The first, [Point Process Tools](https://git.geomar.de/open-source/point-process-tools) is writen in MATLAB. The second, [**PointProcessTools.jl**](https://git.geomar.de/open-source/pointprocesstools.jl) is a package for Julia with some improvements over the former and is the one currently actively maintained.

I am also in early stage of development of the [PointProcesses.jl](https://github.com/JoseKling/PointProcesses.jl) package in cooperation with other researchers. The aim is to develop a complete package for simulation, inference and testing for temporal point processes. 

If you want to know more about my academic background and works that I have developed, check [my page](https://josekling.github.io/).

Feel free to take a look at my projects. **If you have any questions, suggestions, requests or just want to get in touch, you are more than welcome to send me an e-mail.**
  
Cheers,

José Kling
