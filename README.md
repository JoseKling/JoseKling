**Greetings and welcome to my GitHub page.**

I have a B.A. and a M.A. in mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences at the University of São Paulo.
I am currently a PhD candidate at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, researching long term relation between climate and volcanism, especially the statistical modeling of the time distribution of eruptions and goodness-of-fit tests for point processes.
There are two packages that originated from this research, implementing estimation, simulation, and testing for point processes. The first, [Point Process Tools](https://git.geomar.de/open-source/point-process-tools) is writen in MATLAB. The second, [**PointProcessTools.jl**](https://git.geomar.de/open-source/pointprocesstools.jl) is a package for Julia with some improvements over the former and is the one currently actively maintained.
Feel free to take a look at my projects. **If you have any questions, suggestions, requests or just want to get in touch, you are more than welcome to send me an e-mail.**
  
Cheers,
José Kling
